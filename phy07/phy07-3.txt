Implement function

extern void normalize_path(char * path);

which handles filepathes (ending with any symbol except /) and directory pathes (ending with /).

Function must convert text to the canonic form:

    remove duplication of consecutive /
    handle fragments ./ and ../

It's forbidden to use string library function.

Use pointer arithmetic.
