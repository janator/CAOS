Implement a function on asm-x86 (IA-32) or x86-64 with this signature:

extern void mergesort(int from, int to, const int *in, int *out);
      

This function should do merge sort of integers.

Parameters from and to are indices of left and right boundaries of sorting areas; in is a source array, out - a pointer to the allocated memory for the result.

Use only stack memory, usage of the heap is forbidden.
